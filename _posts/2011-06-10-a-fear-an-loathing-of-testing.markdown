**Ash**: *We were somewhere around the waterfall, on the edge of the software lifecycle, when the tests began to take hold. I remember saying something like:*

<br/>
I feel a bit lightheaded. Maybe you should drive.

<br/>
*Suddenly, there was a terrible roar all around us, and the software was full of what looked like huge bugs, all swooping and screeching and diving around the computer, and a voice was screaming:*

<br/>
Holy Jesus. What are these goddamn bugs?

<br/>
**Dr. Gonzo**: Did you say something?

<br/>
**Ash**: Hm? Never mind. It's your turn to test.

<br/>
**Ash**: *No point in mentioning these bugs, I thought. Poor bastard will see them soon enough.*
