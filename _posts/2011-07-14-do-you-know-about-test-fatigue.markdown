We could rewrite the above quote to be:

Test fatigue is a normal result of testing, delivery pressures, thrashing, uninteresting work, disenfranchisement, mechanical work, bad practices and working overtime.

Whatâ€™s wrong with that?

> ...mental fatigue, in turn, can manifest itself both as somnolence (decreased wakefulness), or just as a general decrease of attention, not necessarily including sleepiness. Decreased attention is known as ego depletion and occurs when the limited 'self regulatory capacity' is depleted. It may also be described as a more or less decreased level of consciousness. In any case, this can be dangerous when performing tasks that require constant concentration, such as driving a vehicle... \[or testing\]\[[1]\]


This is a big topic, we have a lot more to say...stay tuned.
