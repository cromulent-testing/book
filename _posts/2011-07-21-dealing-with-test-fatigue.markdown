Here are the problems we raised in our [last post](http://cromulent-testing.com/2011/07/14/do-you-know-about-test-fatigue.html) and ways we deal with them.

**working overtime** - You can’t test tired. If you’re going to be working overtime for several hours, have a break. Take time away from the project and go out for dinner, like a second lunch. Adjust the workplace to your style, watch [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0) together and take frequent communal breaks.

**delivery pressures** - The more pressure the team is under, the more likely they are to make mistakes and the more you need to test. [DON’T PANIC.](http://bit.ly/lOw9RM) The less time you have the more you need to get it right the first time.

**thrashing** - Make a task list of what needs doing and divvy up the work. Stop people from interrupting (think: cone of silence) by politely explaining the urgency of what you’re working on.  Remember, prioritisation! It’s normally better to finish some things than to partially complete lots of them.

**uninteresting work** - Spice up boring work by trying it in a new way. Any technique will do, invent your own or try something from your [favourite testing blog](http://cromulent-testing.com). You can make work fun.

**mechanical work** - Automate it, computers love repetitive tasks. Even if you [dispose of it later](http://cromulent-testing.com/2011/07/05/disposable-automation.html), you’re saving time. Delegate it to the development team, they love repetitive tasks.

**bad practices & disenfranchisement** - Why are you doing this to yourself? Good testers are a rare  breed. Other companies want you, we want you. If you can’t fix it, leave.
