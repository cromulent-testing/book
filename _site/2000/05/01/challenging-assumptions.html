<p>Many bugs can be prevented by challenging assumptions. Challenging the assumptions every one holds as well as paying attention to the seemingly small ones, will yield great results.</p>

<p>Small things can be the most dangerous as they tend to go unnoticed, then gang up on you. It’s more common for projects to get overwhelmed by a build up of small things. The devil’s in the detail.</p>

<p>To find assumptions, listen to the way people speak. Assumptions can found in sentences that contain:</p>

<ul>
<li>must, always, mandatory, required</li>

<li>impossible, inconceivable, never</li>

<li>should, ought</li>

<li>doesn’t make sense</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p><em>Doesn’t make sense is a favourite.</em> This planet is filled with humans who do many things that make more money than sense.</p>

<h3 id='an_example'>An Example!</h3>

<p>Consider the following story:</p>

<p><em>As a customer</em> <br /> <em>I want to know the average activity</em> <br /> <em>So that I can compare this month’s activity against the average</em> <br /></p>

<p>Sounds simple&#8230; but if you look a little deeper:</p>

<ul>
<li>What do we mean by ‘know’?</li>

<li>What do we mean by average? <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_mean'>Geometric</a>, <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_mean'>harmonic</a> or <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean'>arithmetic mean</a>?</li>

<li>What activity?</li>

<li>What do you mean by month? <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Month#Months_in_various_calendars'>How many days are in it?</a></li>

<li>Over what time span is the average calculated? Does it <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average'>move</a>?</li>

<li>How are the numbers rounded? How is the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding#Tie-breaking'>tie broken</a>?</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember, the most hidden assumptions are those you yourself hold. As a tester, you need to challenge yourself and question everything.</p>
