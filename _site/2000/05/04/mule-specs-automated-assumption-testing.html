<p>In our last post we talked about <a href='http://cromulent-testing.com/2011/08/25/mule-testing-proactively-testing-assumptions.html'>mule testing</a>. Assumptions need automation because they’re the foundation our systems are built upon; they can change at anytime. Mule specs are a way to automate mule tests.</p>

<p>You can use any automated testing tool - the one your project already uses is probably fine. Unless it’s QTP. Below is the example from the <a href='http://cromulent-testing.com/2011/08/25/mule-testing-proactively-testing-assumptions.html'>last post</a> in RSpec using the sequel gem.</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='n'>describe</span> <span class='s1'>&#39;products&#39;</span> <span class='k'>do</span>
  <span class='n'>it</span> <span class='s1'>&#39;do not require a category&#39;</span> <span class='k'>do</span>
    <span class='n'>sql</span> <span class='o'>=</span> <span class='o'>&lt;&lt;-</span><span class='no'>SQL</span>
<span class='sh'>      SELECT count(1) as row_count</span>
<span class='sh'>      FROM product</span>
<span class='sh'>      WHERE category IS NULL</span>
<span class='no'>    SQL</span>

    <span class='n'>at_least_one_row_exists</span> <span class='n'>sql</span>
  <span class='k'>end</span>
<span class='k'>end</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>We use two helper functions as we phrase our tests to expect either at least one result or no results.</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='k'>def</span> <span class='nf'>at_least_one_row_exists</span> <span class='n'>sql</span>
  <span class='no'>DB</span><span class='o'>[</span><span class='n'>sql</span><span class='o'>][</span><span class='ss'>:row_count</span><span class='o'>].</span><span class='n'>should</span> <span class='o'>!=</span> <span class='mi'>0</span>
<span class='k'>end</span>

<span class='k'>def</span> <span class='nf'>no_rows_exists</span> <span class='n'>sql</span>
  <span class='no'>DB</span><span class='o'>[</span><span class='n'>sql</span><span class='o'>][</span><span class='ss'>:row_count</span><span class='o'>].</span><span class='n'>should</span> <span class='o'>==</span> <span class='mi'>0</span>
<span class='k'>end</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<h3 id='getting_production_data'>Getting production data</h3>

<p>Mule tests require prod data, the older and less realistic it is, the less certainty you have in your assumptions. Running Mule Specs on production data doesn’t mean running them on production, that’s a really bad idea. Copy the data elsewhere before execution. We arranged a sync from production every night and our Mule Specs run against it. So, when we arrive in the morning we know that as of yesterday, all our assumptions are still true.</p>

<p>Mule specs give us more than just a way of verifying assumptions. Written well, with good reporting, you produce verified documentation that’s updated every night when the mules run. Get the entire team involved. Ensure the analysts note their assumptions as they go and have the testers and developers implement them.</p>

<p>Follow your heart, run with the mules every night.</p>
