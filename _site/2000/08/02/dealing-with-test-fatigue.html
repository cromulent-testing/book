<p>Here are the problems we raised in our <a href='http://cromulent-testing.com/2011/07/14/do-you-know-about-test-fatigue.html'>last post</a> and ways we deal with them.</p>

<p><strong>working overtime</strong> - You can’t test tired. If you’re going to be working overtime for several hours, have a break. Take time away from the project and go out for dinner, like a second lunch. Adjust the workplace to your style, watch <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0'>YouTube</a> together and take frequent communal breaks.</p>

<p><strong>delivery pressures</strong> - The more pressure the team is under, the more likely they are to make mistakes and the more you need to test. <a href='http://bit.ly/lOw9RM'>DON’T PANIC.</a> The less time you have the more you need to get it right the first time.</p>

<p><strong>thrashing</strong> - Make a task list of what needs doing and divvy up the work. Stop people from interrupting (think: cone of silence) by politely explaining the urgency of what you’re working on. Remember, prioritisation! It’s normally better to finish some things than to partially complete lots of them.</p>

<p><strong>uninteresting work</strong> - Spice up boring work by trying it in a new way. Any technique will do, invent your own or try something from your <a href='http://cromulent-testing.com'>favourite testing blog</a>. You can make work fun.</p>

<p><strong>mechanical work</strong> - Automate it, computers love repetitive tasks. Even if you <a href='http://cromulent-testing.com/2011/07/05/disposable-automation.html'>dispose of it later</a>, you’re saving time. Delegate it to the development team, they love repetitive tasks.</p>

<p><strong>bad practices &amp; disenfranchisement</strong> - Why are you doing this to yourself? Good testers are a rare breed. Other companies want you, we want you. If you can’t fix it, leave.</p>
