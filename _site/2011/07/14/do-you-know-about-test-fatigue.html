<p>We could rewrite the above quote to be:</p>

<p>Test fatigue is a normal result of testing, delivery pressures, thrashing, uninteresting work, disenfranchisement, mechanical work, bad practices and working overtime.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8230;mental fatigue, in turn, can manifest itself both as somnolence (decreased wakefulness), or just as a general decrease of attention, not necessarily including sleepiness. Decreased attention is known as ego depletion and occurs when the limited &#8216;self regulatory capacity&#8217; is depleted. It may also be described as a more or less decreased level of consciousness. In any case, this can be dangerous when performing tasks that require constant concentration, such as driving a vehicle&#8230; [or testing][<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)'>1</a>]</p>
