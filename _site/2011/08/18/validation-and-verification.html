<p>So what is the difference?</p>

<p>It’s simple really, as long as you don’t read the plethora of arduous ISO and IEEE standards.</p>

<p><strong>Verification</strong> is making sure what we built is working as we intended. This is acceptance testing, executable specifications and exploratory testing. These are testing fundamentals.</p>

<p><strong>Validation</strong> is asking the question, did we build the right thing? There is little point in building a entirely configurable system if the owners have no want or need to.</p>

<p>Our definitions, like most of the ones we’ve found, are defined in the past tense, which illustrates the real problem. Why wait to ask such important questions? It’s <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZeYVIWz99I'>Madness!</a></p>

<p>Ask these questions early and often, then you’ll never have to bother with these definitions again:</p>

<ul>
<li>Are building the right thing?</li>

<li>Is it working?</li>
</ul>

<p>Defining your testing as verification or validation is largely irrelevant in the grand scheme of things. Dissecting testing into small chunks is a useful way to learn new things, however in the real world, evolving your expertise to include new things, like user experience design, is more effective.</p>
